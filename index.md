## Welcome to GitHub Pages

###  HW requirements:
- Raspberry Pi model 3 or newer recommended
- Microsoft Wireless Number Pad or a physical USB keyboard (latter works without out of the box) 
- USB mouse to start the match, navigate stats (bluetooth mouse works as well)
- Raspberry Pi Micro USB Cable with ON/Off Switch (optional, it can be any other Micro USB cable)
- HDMI cable
- A TV or monitor, the current setup doesn't support an external touchscreen as I don't have one



You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/miklos-szel/rpi-darts-scorer/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/miklos-szel/rpi-darts-scorer/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
